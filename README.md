I came across a tweet by @Olaoluwa__Mercy on Twitter. The tweet mentioned the following:

"A school had their students' records stored in a Word document, but they required them in a spreadsheet format. 

As someone who is proficient with Excel, what approach would you use to accomplish this?

Manual data entry is not an option."

In response to this challenge, I decided to participate, and it led me to discover new Excel functions. I gained valuable knowledge through this exercise, and I'm pleased that I decided to take part.


## The Word Document

The Word document provided includes student records featuring the following information across its 13 pages:
- Student Name
- Title
- Highest Education
- GMAT Score
- IELTS Score
- Previous University

  
Please access the Word document shared by Mercy at [this link](https://t.co/OLCiCu42cT) for downloading.

## Solution

To address the issue, I first converted the Word document into PDF format and then imported it into the Power Query Editor within Excel.

Afterward, I continued by merging all the pages to unify all the records onto one sheet. Then, I split the column using a ":" as the delimiter.

Subsequently, I loaded the data into Excel.

I used the WRAPROWS() function to organize and group the data into their respective columns. Below is the formula used:

```
=WRAPROWS(B3:B308,6)
```

"The formula below accomplishes the same result. Here's an explanation of how it works:

`=INDEX(B3:B308,SEQUENCE(COUNTA(B3:B308)/6,6,1,1))`

This formula achieves a similar outcome and here's how it functions:"

The formula you provided, `=INDEX(B3:B308,SEQUENCE(COUNTA(B3:B308)/6,6,1,1))`, is an Excel formula that is used to create a new table or array from a range of cells in the `B` column. Let's break it down step by step:

1. `COUNTA(B3:B308)`: This part of the formula calculates the count of non-empty cells in the range `B3:B308`. It counts how many cells in that range contain data.

2. `COUNTA(B3:B308)/6`: This part divides the count from step 1 by 6. This division result represents the number of rows you want in your new array. It's essentially determining how many groups of 6 rows can be created from the data.

3. `SEQUENCE(COUNTA(B3:B308)/6, 6, 1, 1)`: The `SEQUENCE` function is used to create a sequence of numbers in an array. In this case:
   - The first argument, `COUNTA(B3:B308)/6`, specifies the number of rows in the new array, which was calculated in step 2. This determines how many rows the new array will have.
   - The second argument, `6`, specifies the number of columns in the new array. You want 6 columns in each row.
   - The third argument, `1`, specifies the start value of the sequence. It starts at 1.
   - The fourth argument, `1`, specifies the increment between values in the sequence. It increments by 1 for each value in the sequence.

4. `INDEX(B3:B308, ... )`: The `INDEX` function is used to return values from a specified range based on row and column numbers. In this case, it's being used to extract values from the original range `B3:B308` using the row and column numbers generated by the `SEQUENCE` function.

So, when you put it all together, this formula takes the data in the `B3:B308` range and organizes it into a new array with the specified number of rows and columns, where each row contains 6 values from the original data. It's a way to split the data into groups of 6 rows per group.
